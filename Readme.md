## Setup Instructions

**Clone the Repository:**

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/sushmitamore11/Test-Automation-Framework.git

  cd Test-Automation-Framework
```
    
**Running Tests on LambdaTest:**

```bash
  mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=true -DisHeadless=false -X
```

**Running Tests on Chrome browser on Local Machine in Headless Mode:**

```bash
  mvn test  -Dbrowser=chrome -DisLambdaTest=false -DisHeadless=true -X
```
    
## Reports & Logs
Reports: After execution, a detailed HTML report will be generated at ./report.html.

The report contains information on test cases executed, passed, failed, and skipped, along with screenshots for failed tests.

## Logs:
Logs are created during the test execution and stored in the ./logs/ directory.

## Integrated the project Github Actions
This automation framework is integrated with github actions. The tests will be executed at 11:30PM IST every single day.

The reports will be archieved in gh-pages branch You can view the html reports at :
